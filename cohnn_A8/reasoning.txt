# Reasoning for Preprocessing Airbnb NY Dataset

## Identify Missing Values
There were multiple steps to do this.
First, we had to remove all the newlines in the csv that weren't used to separate rows as this messed up the `awk` function as it separates records based on newlines.
Second, we replaced any leading and trailing spaces with an empty string in case there were any that prevented us from detecting missing values.
Third, we replaced any missing values with NA, as we don't know what effect replacing numbers with 0's would have. 
Fourth and finally, for our remove function, we just searched if a line had ',NA', ',NA,', or 'NA,' and removed that line from the csv file.

## Remove Duplicate Entries
Duplicate entries can skew analysis results. We removed duplicates using `awk` to ensure each entry is unique.

## Identifying and Handling Outliers
Outliers can distort statistical analysis, so we identified outliers in the "price" column by calculating the mean and removing entries that exceed three times the mean price.

## Conclusion
These preprocessing steps ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, making it suitable for merging with other Airbnb datasets from different regions.
